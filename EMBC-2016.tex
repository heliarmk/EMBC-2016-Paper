\begin{abstract}
This is the abstract. You can use this file to start your own LaTeX file,
and just delete the stuff you do not need. \LaTeX  is a lot like working
with HTML: you can specify where text effects begin, and where they end.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Managing diseases and health issues is worldwide still more expensive especially with aging population. For instance there are around 22 million people affected with heart failure.  These people have been treated in hospitals for a long time. Nowadays, the situation is changing because relatively cheap solutions for home treatment is coming to market. These solutions usually use a set of sensors for monitoring of a health level. Data from these sensors are transfered to remote servers where are they are processed and results are visualized to the user. Sensors usually measure a large collection of body parameters. Integration of these sensors create a Body Area Network (BAN). When the number of sensors connected to BAN is increasing a management and long term storage and sustainability of data is a major requirement in future applications.

What if you want to include a figure? 
Here is an example, figure~\ref{fig:phasor1}, that is saved in 
encapsulated postscript format.

\section{Here is some Computer Code}\label{sec:code}

I like using the \verb"verbatim" specification for computer code. 
For example, here is something that appears in several
languages:

\begin{verbatim}
    for (int i=0; i< MAXVALUE-1; i++)
    {
        if (array[i] < array[i+1]) 
        {
            temp = array[i];
            array[i] = array[i+1];
            array[i+1] = temp;
        }
    }
\end{verbatim}

See how it makes the code stand out? I think it makes it
much easier to read, too.

\section{Here is some Math}\label{sec:math}
This is different from the previous section, section~\ref{sec:intro}.
This section gives some examples of Math.



If you use a character, but LaTeX complains about it, try putting a 
back-slash before it. For example, 
f = x\^{}y  uses the carat character. 
If you want to end a line, use 2 back-slashes.
If you want the backslash character $\backslash$ in your document,
this can be done, too.

Here's an equation:

\[ M^\bot = \{ f \in V' : f(m) = 0 \mbox{ for all } m \in M \}.\]

Here's d2u/dx2 : (use the dollar sign before and after math stuff)

$ \frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} $

Here's another equation:

\[ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{3x^2 +7x^3}{x^2 +5x^4} = 3.\]

Here's a summation:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{1}{2} n (n+1).\] 

and an integral:
\[ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx.\]

Here are some Greek letters:
$ \Delta \Psi \Phi $
and some lower case ones:
$ \delta \psi \phi \omega \pi \sigma \mu $.

\section{Filler}

It is always a good idea to have text between a section header and
a subheading.
